# 🔄 NEAR Intent Swap Agent

A CLI agent for intent-driven token swaps on the NEAR blockchain, built with [`@iqai/adk`](https://github.com/IQAICOM/adk-ts). This project enables safe, automated, and user-friendly NEAR token swaps using natural language prompts.

## ✨ Features
- Intent-based NEAR token swaps via CLI
- Automated account import and token discovery
- Handles NEAR and NEP-141 tokens with correct decimal scaling
- Built-in session management and safety checks
- Extensible with new tools and services

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IQAICOM/near-intent-swap-agent.git
   cd near-intent-swap-agent
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   # Edit .env and provide your GOOGLE_API_KEY and (optionally) NEAR credentials
   ```
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is required for some agent features ([get it here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)).
   - `USER_ACCOUNT_ID` and `USER_ACCOUNT_KEY` are needed for NEAR account operations.
   - `NEAR_NODE_URL` defaults to public mainnet if not set.

4. **Run the agent:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## 🧑‍💻 Usage
- Start the CLI and follow prompts to perform NEAR swaps
- The agent will import your NEAR account (if credentials are provided) and fetch available tokens.
- All token amounts must be input using the correct decimals (see CLI instructions for details).
- Type `quit` or `exit` to end the session.
